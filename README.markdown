# M.F. Tanks

A simple tank battle game, where you design your tank's "AI" to survive and
grow.

The goal is to have both single- and multi-player modes:

In single-player mode, you don't need any form of webserver; simply load a
static html file with the file:// protocol, and it pulls in everything it needs
to get a game going.

In multi-player mode, you'll need a server, and some clients. The server runs
in node.js. It serves up the game client page to players, and acts as a
websocket server to tell the clients what to render. Clients connect and tell
the server how they'd like their tank configured, and then render whatever the
server tells them about.

## Requirements
